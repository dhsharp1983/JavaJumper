# Introduction

In the simple RPG game, Java Jumper, your character plays a teenager who is trapped in the Nowhere Dimension. As you can guess, this is not a place you want to be growing up in. However, it is possible to escape the dimension through a dimensional portal. Unfortunately, these portals only appear at the top of a random building once every week, and they are fiercely guarded by the Nowhere Police, who use them to shuttle things and people in and out of the Nowhere Dimension.

The objective of the game is for the player to guide their character out of the Nowhere Dimension towards the exit portal while avoiding the Nowhere Police. But the main question is how, since all buildings have their rooftop access restricted.

Fortunately for us, the Nowhere Underground has procured a jumper device. This device allows the wearer to create mini-portals that allow the wearer to ‘jump’ between endpoints. This device can allow the player to safely jump to the roofs of buildings and bypass the rooftop access restrictions. 

Unfortunately, not everything in life is perfect. While the device can be quite handy, it is not nearly powerful enough to create a portal equivalent to the escape portal. Its range is also limited. While the player’s character has managed to 'acquire' this device, the supplementary power supply was not obtained. As such, the device can only hold the power for a fixed number of jumps before its battery runs out. While the battery can be recharged via power cells found distributed on building rooftops, this would still require the jumper to jump to these buildings in order to obtain the required power cells.

The game is over when one of the following occurs:
 - The player manages to jump to the building which has the exit portal on it.
 - The player’s jumper device runs out of charge and is unable to jump anymore.
